## Investment Optimization Algorithms

### Overview

This project focuses on optimizing investment portfolios using brute force and optimized algorithms. The goal is to maximize profits while considering constraints like cost and return on investment over two years.

### Features

- Brute force algorithm for profit maximization.
- Optimized algorithm to handle larger datasets efficiently.
- Visual comparison of algorithm complexities.
- Portfolio and action management features.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Loytifi/investment-optimizer.git

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Usage

Run the main script:

```
python main.py
```
## Example

Here is a simple example of how the program outputs a portfolio:


Selected Portfolio:
- Action: "TechCorp", Price: 200, Profit: 30%
- Action: "HealthInc", Price: 150, Profit: 25%

Total Cost: $350
Total Profit: $105
